Through [Socrata Labs](http://labs.socrata.com), we're excited to announce the beta launch of our new [Global Catalog Search API](http://labs.socrata.com/docs/search.html). The new global search API will allow you to search for public datasets across any of our public data portals. This is a first for the Socrata platform!

In addition, we're introducing new semantic categorization functionality to that catalog that makes use of machine learning techniques to categorize datasets based on their metadata and contents. So whether a dataset is tagged by a provider as "public safety", "police", or "crime", we'll always categorize it as a "Crime" dataset.

You can also experiment with this new search API via the [Open Data Network](http://www.opendatanetwork.com) catalog, which makes use of the same API. Like all Socrata Labs APIs, the Export API is beta, and subject to change as we get feedback from the community.
