Through [Socrata Labs](http://labs.socrata.com), we're excited to announce the beta launch of our new [Export API](http://labs.socrata.com/docs/search.html). The new export service allows you to more efficiently export any public Socrata dataset, including the ability to filter that export by any valid [SoQL Query](/docs/queries/).

Check out [the documentation](http://labs.socrata.com/docs/export.html) and send us feedback. Like all Socrata Labs APIs, the Export API is beta, and subject to change as we get feedback from the community.
